<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p class="paragraph">Play Roshambo against the evil Dr. Markov. Madeline the dog will move up or down depending on your win or lose at each turn.  Madeline gets to escape when you win the game. You can improve your odds of winning by analyzing data in a graph and recognizing patterns in Markov's action.</p>

    <li>Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons for your play against Markov.</li>
    <li>Game ends when Madeline escapes or gets banished back to the lab.</li>

    </ol>
</p>
