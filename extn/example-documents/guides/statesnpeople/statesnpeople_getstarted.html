<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>These are data gathered from the Minnesota Population Center. It provides aggregate information for each state. Play around with the data by hovering over the column headings (attributes) in the table to discover more about your data set. </p>
<p><b>The Case Table and the Map</b>
<ul>
    <li>Try dragging a column header into the map and see what happens.</li>
    <li>To change the data displayed in the map, drag a different column header from the table to the map. What do you think the different shades on the map mean?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>The Graph</b>
<p>To a see a different visualization of the data, click on the Graph icon <img class="icon" src="../images/graph_icon.png"></p>
<ul>
    <li>The graph is just a series of dots now. What do the dots represent?</li>
    <li>Play around with the graph by placing attributes on both the x and y axes to see what you discover. You can either replace an attribute by dragging another into the yellow space in the graph. </li>
    <li>Alternatively if you want to change something in the graph, you can click on the label and a menu of attributes will appear. You can select from that menu and watch the data move around.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>What sense are you making of these data? What discoveries and what questions do you have?</p>
