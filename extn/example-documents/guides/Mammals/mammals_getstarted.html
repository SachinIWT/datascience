<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>This data set has information on 27 mammals.  Check out the table and the graphs to see what you can learn about them.</p>
<p><b>Examine the tables and graphs</b>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out how fast a cheetah goes?</li>
    <li>Look in the left-most graph and click on the dot next to Cheetah. What do you see in the other graphs? Can you tell from a graph what type of diet a cheetah has?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the LifeSpan graph (middle graph). Can you tell what the lifespan of a cheetah is?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Create your own graph</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the Graph icon <img class="icon" src="../images/graph_icon.png"> What do you think those dots represent?</li>
    <li>Drag a column header (attribute) to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the y-axis attribute and the x-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select Remove X or Remove Y</li>
</ul>
